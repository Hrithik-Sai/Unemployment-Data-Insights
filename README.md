# Objective
The initiative aims to reduce the NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) rate for youth aged 15 to 24 by fostering inclusive economic growth, empowering young people through education and training, mitigating economic stagnation, and promoting social equity by addressing barriers such as socio-economic disadvantages and discrimination.

The plot illustrates the distribution of a variable (ranging from 0 to 80) across two gender groups: females (represented in green) and males (represented in orange). Key features include:
Distributions: Each group’s data is displayed as a violin plot, showing the density and distribution of the variable.
Central Tendency: The thick black lines within each violin likely represent the median or mean values of the distributions.
Data Year: The analysis is based on data from the year 2015.
This visualization provides insights into the comparative distributions and central tendencies of the variable across different genders.


# Graph Description: Age Groups and Statistical Distributions (2014)
<img width="777" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceca21ef-032a-499d-bb52-a734772afdce">

Youth (Green): Symmetric distribution with narrow IQR and minimal outliers.
Adults (Orange): Broader, right-skewed distribution with a higher median and wider IQR, including some outliers.
Children (Purple): Left-skewed distribution with a lower median, moderate IQR, and a few outliers.
This graph visually represents the distribution patterns of different age groups for 2014, highlighting variations in age and variability.


# Heatmap Representation
The heatmap visualizes data across various age groups and categories with a color gradient from blue to green:

Categories: The y-axis displays categories including ‘Adults,’ ‘Teenagers,’ and ‘Youth.’

Age Groups: The x-axis is labeled with age groups: ‘15-24,’ ‘25+,’ and ‘Under 15.’

Color Intensity: Color intensity ranges from light blue (approximately 350) to dark green (approximately 410), as indicated by the scale on the right side.

This heatmap facilitates the analysis of demographic patterns or trends associated with the specified age groups and categories.

# Trend Analysis for India - Unemployment Rate by Sex and Age (Female, 15-24 Youth):
<img width="748" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95400090-443f-4f15-8442-a28d1782ce56">


2014: The female youth unemployment rate in India started around 20%.

2017 and 2019: It peaked at approximately 24% during these years.

2022: There was a sharp drop, bringing it below 20%.

2024: The rate slightly increased from the 2022 low.

# Correlation Matrix of Year Columns
The correlation matrix visualizes the pairwise correlations between years from 2014 to 2024:
<img width="678" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/663133c5-3785-47ab-afff-e5901e8d7fba">


Matrix Structure: The matrix is square, with both the horizontal and vertical axes labeled with years from 2014 to 2024.

Diagonal: The diagonal cells, extending from the top-left to the bottom-right, show a correlation value of 1.00, indicating perfect self-correlation for each year.

Color Scale: The color scale on the right side ranges from red (indicating strong positive correlation) to blue (indicating weaker correlation).

This matrix enables quick assessment of the strength of correlations between different years, providing valuable insights for statistical analysis and forecasting.

# Trend Analysis
Trend Graph: The top graph depicts a fluctuating trend with a peak around 2018, followed by a gradual decline. This illustrates the long-term trend in the data.
Seasonal Graph: The middle graph presents a periodic wavy pattern oscillating around the zero line, indicating seasonal variations with regular, repeating patterns.
Residuals Graph: The bottom graph shows residual points clustered around the zero line with minimal deviation, reflecting small or negligible remaining effects after accounting for trend and seasonality.

This analysis provides a clear view of long-term trends, seasonal variations, and residual effects within the dataset.

# Analysis Overview
In this section, I've provided an analysis of the unemployment rate in the country based on the dataset. The visualizations include:
Trend Analysis: Examines long-term fluctuations and trends.

Seasonal Patterns: Identifies regular, repeating variations.

Residuals: Shows the minimal remaining effects after accounting for trend and seasonality.

Additionally, the dataset includes unemployment data from other countries that should also be analyzed. For a detailed examination, I’ve included Python code that can be executed to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the data. Running the provided code will allow for an in-depth understanding and exploration of the unemployment trends and patterns across different countries.
